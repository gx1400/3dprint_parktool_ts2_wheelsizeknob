# Park tool TS-2 wheel size replacement knob

Knob broke on my old TS-2 stand.  Replacement Kit (216S) is $12, but hey I have a 3d printer!

I heated up threaded rod with a blow torch and just pressed into place.  Tried to design to be pressfit on knurled section but my printer isn't tuned and printed hole undersized, so hot fit it is!
